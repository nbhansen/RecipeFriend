Deprecated note: This folder is now the primary, standalone Chrome MV3 extension. The official webextension polyfill is used, and no shim is required. If this file is still present, itâ€™s safe to delete.
Only a Manifest V3 manifest is provided here. All other assets are referenced relatively from ../extension.
